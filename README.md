A Flutter-based dummy application used to demonstrate the working of a Smart Privacy Assistant prototype.

                              1.(Getting Started)

This project is a demonstration dummy app that simulates a real-world shopping application (similar to Amazon) to show how the Smart Privacy Assistant helps users understand privacy risks before accepting permissions or terms and conditions.

The dummy app is used only for proof of concept and academic demonstration.

                                 2.(Project Purpose)

Most users blindly accept:

Terms & Conditions

Privacy policies

Permission requests (like location access)

-----This dummy app helps demonstrate how our system:-----

Detects privacy-related content

Uses NLP-based keyword detection

Shows system-level notifications

Assists users in making better decisions

                                3.(How the Demo Works)

--User opens the Smart Privacy Assistant app

--User enables the activation toggle

--The dummy app is launched

--When terms, conditions, or permissions appear:

--Keywords are detected

--A system-level notification is shown

--The notification explains risks in simple language

--After reading, the notification disappears

                               4.(Technologies Used)

Flutter

Flask (Backend)

REST API

NLP (Conceptual keyword extraction)

System-level notification model (Prototype)

                           5.(Important Notes) 

This is not a real Amazon app

No real user data is collected

Amazon privacy policy text is used only for demonstration
